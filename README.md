# Surfs_up

## Analysis
The purpose of this challenge is to convince an investor that opening a Surf and Shake shop located in Oahu, Hawaii is a good idea.  The store will serve surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists all year. However, the investor needs a little more convincing since he had a similar business before, and failed due to bad weather conditions.  To go ahead with the plan, the investor needs to have a statistical analysis to help with his decision.  
To help get started with this project, we will be using a Jupyter notebook for our weather analysis.  SQLite database: a database that consists of flat files, meaning they are stored locally, which will help a programmer move faster with their analysis.  And SQLalchemy connects and generates queries to pull the necessary information for the analysis.

## Results
When looking at the results that were collected from the analysis, it looks like the mean temperature for the month of June and December are around the 70s.  And the maximum temperature for the month of June was 85 and for December it was 83. And the low temperatures were in the 60s for June and in the 50s for December.  These numbers are still good for a surf shop and an Ice Cream store.

Also, Looking at the plot provided below, we can also see that there is no difference in the temperatures between the months of June and December.  Usually, in other states, June is always hotter than December and there is a huge gap in temperatures. ![Screenshot 2022-12-08 142956](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114379268/206617373-d158a5df-4c99-4d46-8050-959c684d665a.png)

Looking over other months besides June and December precipitation is very low in Oahu, Hawaii.  Therefore, the chances for the store to succeed are very high.  We can see from the charts and the plot that in any season, whether it is in the spring, fall, or winter precipitation is very low.  And with the median temperatures of the 70s, the store hopefully will succeed.
